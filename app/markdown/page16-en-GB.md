Launched in 2007, the China Cup is the first Chinese international sailing competition and the only big sailing race that is hosted in and named after China. Having held 11 successful events, the China Cup has established itself as a Chinese brand of sailing sport and an conveyer of elegant Chinese lifestyle.

Guan Xiaoyu, the founder and COO of the China Cup, says he hope that by hosting sailing competition, “the China Cup can serve as a platform that embraces and links leaders from different industries and thus radiate social influence.”

As one of the leading blockchains in China, En-Tan-Mo upholds the vision of “agreed value, shared benefit”, with a never-ending commitment to build an efficient, open and safe blockchain 3.0 platform of equilibrium and connectivity and to usher in a new generation of balanced value transfer system. In the world of En-Tan-Mo, block producers and Pareto mining pools support and reinforce each other under Kantorovich consensus; all kinds of applications and communities, be it blockchain or non-blockchain, are welcome to run and grow. In this way participants who long for fairness, democracy and freedom are empowered to maximize their fair share of benefits from the wave of decentralization brought by blockchain technology.

What En-Tan-Mo has been trying to achieve is be the driver behind the force of social influence, but more importantly become the force itself. 

Thanks to the many actors like En-Tan-Mo, Guan Xiaoyu notes, the China Cup nowadays goes beyond a sport event to the demonstration of a brand new lifestyle and to an ocean carnival that combines sport with commerce, culture, art and activities of public welfare.
