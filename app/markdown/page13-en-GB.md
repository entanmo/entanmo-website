On August 29th 2018, En-Tan-Mo held its first North American roadshow and project launch meeting in Silicon Valley. This event was sponsored by En-Tan-Mo Foundation and organized with the support of Canaan Group and OnePiece.

Several important figures in the science and financial world, home and aboard, were present at the event to bear witness to the thrilling moment of the launch of En-Tan-Mo project, including Nobel-Prize winning economist and En-Tan-Mo chief economic advisor Prof. Thomas J. Sargent; Nobel-Prize winning physicist and En-Tan-Mo chief physics advisor Prof. Sheldon Lee Glashow; En-Tan-Mo chief science advisor Dr. Aaron Yuan.

En-Tan-Mo is a next-generation blockchain based on Nash equilibrium and the idea of value transfer. The project was initiated by a group of mathematicians from France. They implemented game theory in blockchain development and named the project after Entente, Transaction and Mobius. They were later joined by experts in telecommunication, computer science and economics and philosophy of California Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland and the institut Henri Poincare. 

With two Nobel Prize laureates as advisors, En-Tan-Mo has laid a solid theoretical basis.

The foundation of En-Tan-Mo economics derives from Prof. Thomas J. Sargent’s thought. The Nobel-winning economist once observed,“ ETM is pressing the frontier forward by completely understanding the best blockchain technology that exists today but finding problems even in the best blockchain technologies.” Following the principles of game theory and distributed system, En-Tan-Mo gives shape to its underlying consensus and equilibrium-based economic architecture, with in-depth implementation of Professor Sargent’s rational expectation model and time series analysis. 

As one of the founders of the standard model of particle physics, Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow devotes his life to the studies of elementary particles and quantum field theory. “The blockchain revolution that was invented about ten years ago led to the creation of cryptocurrencies,” he says, “En-Tan-Mo blockchain intends to address these challenges with a remarkable consortium of scholars. Using the blockchain technology, En-Tan-Mo can and will enable secure peer-to-peer transmission of financial instruments and information, thus providing the essentials that the internet lacks, absolute privacy on the one hand and permanent record-keeping on the other.”

Back in 2015, Dr. Aaron Yuan, En-Tan-Mo chief science advisor, drew the attention of blockchain communities worldwide to the problem of SHD incompleteness for the first time ever. Three years later, he shared En-Tan-Mo’s solution to the problem at the North America project launch meeting by kicking off with a speech titled “Blockchain 3.0 and SHD Completeness”, in which he unveiled En-Tan-Mo, detailed its unique design ideas and core strengths and discussed the current impediments and future trend of blockchain technologies.

Tapping the best minds in the world to put in place a rigorous development process

En-Tan-Mo is a practical, scientifically rigorous blockchain 3.0 platform co-developed by interdisciplinary scientists and computer engineers, with all its theoretical designs adopting a double verification process. What En-Tan-Mo has achieved so far would be impossible without the close cooperation between different teams and their directors who combine theory with practice, develop complementary software and hardware and integrate technology into commerce. The Kantorovich consensus mechanism was designed by experts in the fields of mathematics, telecommunications and computer science. The framework of “En-Tan-Mo Science” and the underlying stake distribution mechanism was proposed by experts who took part in Ethereum project and KOLs of the blockchain community. Also former software programmers from Google, Thunder, Baidu and other leading Internet companies with rich experience contributed to the original code development of the project.

A solution to the incompatibility between decentralization, security and high-performance

One of the biggest impediments to blockchain development is SHD incompleteness, i.e. the incompatibility between security, high-performance and decentralization. For this En-Tan-Mo’s solution includes: an miner election mechanism, backed by the UPoS-based Kantorovich consensus, to guarantee the independence of stakeholders and mining machines as well as their fair share of rewards; the implementation of Nash equilibrium and mean field game theory in the dedicated mechanisms for stake adjustment, block producer sequencing and dynamic planning so as to deliver quantum security; a multichain structure, composed of a main chain and multiple side chains, to enable the two-way asset transfer between main chain and side chains and between En-Tan-Mo and other blockchains, and to increase En-Tan-Mo’s scalability to 1 million TPS.

A Pareto-based Reward Mechanism

En-Tan-Mo delivers benefits for all. On the one hand, elected block producers forge blocks and win ETM tokens as reward. They work as partners as well as competitors. On the other hand, ordinary miners, each devoting a share of hash power, are able to mine external blockchains in the form of mining pools and gain rewards in proportional to the resources they invest. In this way, a combination of equality, decentralization and optimality is established on the system. What’s more, the increase of DApps on En-Tan-Mo will help to create a coalition with long-term optimal payoffs for ordinary miners who provide hash power, storage and bandwidth. On En-Tan-Mo, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption and hash power waste, and the vision of BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) will come to life as all nodes are providers of decentralized cloud service on a supply-and-demand basis.

Just as Dr. Eyad Abed, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland and Dr. Aaron Yuan’s doctoral supervisor, said what made En-Tan-Mo so special was that it reflected the longing for equality of people from different walks of life, be it entrepreneurs, technical professionals, economists and physicists, who were committed to En-Tan-Mo’s success.

It is fair to say that En-Tan-Mo is a disruptive innovation on blockchain technology and an international project that is at the intersection of philosophy, mathematics, economics and computer science.

En-Tan-Mo sees supply and demand as latitudes and participants as longitudes. Longitudes intersect and create latitudes as they see fit. Together they weave a web that is in constant self-learning and self-improvement through the chaotic shuffling mechanism. The world of En-Tan-Mo is shaped by each and every individuals within and the autonomy allowed makes people more rational, proactive, independent and far-sighted.

“What we work for is not only a user-friendly blockchain but a platform which is as free and equal as possible by having the scale tipped in favor of the majority of ordinary participants,” said Dr. Aaron Yuan at the end of his speech, “ This is the founding mission of En-Tan-Mo and the mission we strive to see it through. ”Indeed. A future of freedom, equality, creativity, equilibrium and efficiency is within our grasp, with the help of En-Tan-Mo.
