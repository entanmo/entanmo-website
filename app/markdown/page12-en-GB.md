On August 28th 2018, the 2018 Sino-US Economists Cooperation Forum, hosted by Stanford University Financial & Risk Model Institute and Canaan Sunshine Group, and sponsored by En-Tan-Mo Foundation, came to a successful conclusion at Stanford, with the support from the consular general of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco.

A galaxy of scientists from the United States and China gathered at the forum to share their insights and gave brilliant speeches on such topics of importance as the recent developments and frontier of fintech innovations as well as the future trend of development for financial industry. They include: Professor Thomas J. Sargent, Nobel Prize-winning economist and En-Tan-Mo chief economic advisor; Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow, Nobel Physics Prize laureate and En-Tan-Mo chief physics advisor; Professor Zhang Shoucheng, Stanford physicist and member of Chinese Academy of Science, National Academy of Science and American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Professor Li Ziliang, head of the Stanford University Financial & Risk Model Institute; Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) principal Professor Zhuo Zhi and associate principal Professor Yi Qinshuang, and SWUFE institution CEO Professor Tang Jiqiang.

During the forum, Professor Thomas J. Sargent enlightened the attendees with his speech on economic models. “Data analysis, no matter how sophisticated, must be tied in to theory, ”he first noted. Then he went on to demonstrate the core algorithms of modern economics, the very foundations for researches in digital economy, blockchain and artificial intelligence, by taking Markov perfect, Stackelberg model and classic monopoly-based and pareto-based game theory models as examples. Analysis were also made on the US-China trade from the game theory angle, where the professor pointed out that both sides should think in a dynamic way and use the ideas of game theory when making strategic decisions and handling their bilateral relations, as both their relations and economic development were in constant changes instead of stationarity.

Blockchain is a conjunction of different disciplines, said Sheldon Lee Glashow in his speech titled scientific and technological revolutions. Every scientific discoveries and innovations, accidental or not, pave the way for the next leap-forward in social development and usher in world-changing scientific revolutions, industrial revolution, digital revolution, quantum revolution, information revolution and the most recent blockchain revolution, among others. 
En-Tan-Mo, firmly grounded in the wisdom of two Nobel-winning scientists,

According to Dr. Aaron Yuan, En-Tan-Mo scientists managed to address the SHD completeness problem, namely, the incompatibility between decentralization, security and high-performance in blockchain systems, through the following innovative approaches: An miner election mechanism, backed by the UPoS-based Kantorovich consensus, guarantees the independence of stakeholders and mining machines as well as their fair share of rewards; Nash equilibrium and mean field game theory are embedded in the dedicated mechanisms for stake adjustment, block producer sequencing and dynamic planning so that the system enjoys quantum security; Having put a multichain structure with a main chain and multiple side chains in position, En-Tan-Mo enables the two-way asset transfer between main chain and side chains and between itself and other blockchains. In this way, it is moving towards a platform with high concurrency and the ability to scale to 1 million TPS.

Dr. Eyad Abeda, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland and Dr. Aaron Yuan’s doctoral supervisor, pointed out that it was the interdisciplinary background that made En-Tan-Mo so special, as it embodied the pursuits of equality of people from different walks of life, be it entrepreneurs, technical professionals, economists and physicists, who were committed to En-Tan-Mo’s success.

Brilliant speeches were also made by scientists and experts of economic, financial and managerial sectors. These speakers include: Zhang Shouyi, professor of Stanford University; Zhuo Zhi, principal of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE); Tang Jiqiang, CEO of SWUFE institution; Kenneth Judd, senior fellow of Hoover Institution at Stanford University; Steve Ciesinski, president of SRI International; Charles Eesley, Professor of the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford University; Jonathan Aeichental, chief information and technology officer at the City of Palo Alto; as well as Weng Zhigang, Zang Wenbin, Li Qin, Wang Peng, Li Zhiyong and Yangwei from SWUFE.

On behalf of the consular general of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco, Mr. Ren Faqiang, deputy consul general, extended his warmest congratulations on the opening of the forum, saying exchanges of fintech practitioners and researchers between China and the United States were highly relevant at such a critical time for our bilateral economic relations and trade ties.  

2018 Sino-US Economists Cooperation Forum is not only an in-depth dialogue but also a close collaboration between the science and finance circles of the two countries, and En-Tan-Mo has played its part to make this happen. 

It is worth mentioning that En-Tan-Mo has never cease in its pursuit of better solutions to the bottlenecks of blockchain’s underlying technologies, with improvements made in areas including hybrid consensus, scalability, stake distribution and quantum security, all of which contribute significantly to fintech research and application as well as a new ecology for China-US innovation and cooperation in this aspect.  

En-Tan-Mo, a short for Entente, Transaction and Mobius, is a next-generation blockchain based on Nash equilibrium and the idea of value transfer.. The core members of En-Tan-Mo team includes Prof. Thomas Sargent, leader of the rational expectation revolution and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics; Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow, the Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who proposed the Grand Unified Theory; as well as scholars of California Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland and the institut Henri Poincare who realized SHD completeness by innovatively incorporating game theory in blockchain development.
