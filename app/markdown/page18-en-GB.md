The winter of 2018 was bitter.

News of lay-off broke one after another, with cash-intensive internet and real estate companies being the first to bear the blunt. As of the latter half of 2018, a host of real estate enterprises reportedly have shed their staff in large numbers, so did well-known internet companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Jindong, Meituan, Douyu and Zhihu. 

Though some of these job cuts were rumors, which were denied soon afterwards, their very existence spoke to a fact that the capital market was about to see a winter, a winter that no one is immune from.

The winter for cryptocurrency in 2018 was freezing.

Speculators who used to exclaim “all in” quickly joined the ranks of the right-defenders within a year. The so-called media under the name of “finance” disappeared overnight, followed by the resignation of key figures in the crypto-industry who were never heard of ever since. 

In the face of the crypto-winter, some ran, some stayed. 
 
Despite a sluggish market, En-Tan-Mo continues to grow strong. The Nash equilibrium-based third generation blockchain platform has finished its Series B by January 2019, raising ¥ 20 million, funded by Wuhan Four-Dimensional Magic Cube Technology Investment Company Limited. 

What drives En-Tan-Mo forward in the worst winter the industry has ever seen?

Bide Our Time

People adore butterflies. Yet seldom do anyone know the hardships they have gone through.

En-Tan-Mo, too, has experienced a long and painful transformation before emerging from the chrysalis. 

Many so-called blockchain projects see their job done the soon as they attract investors by cobbling together a “white book” and having a crypto-guru to endorse them. Unlike them,  En-Tan-Mo spent more than half a year to prepare and polish its white book after the launch of the project in July 2017. 

The En-Tan-Mo white book is the collective wisdom of a group of scientists led by two Nobel Prize-winning laureates of En-Tan-Mo Academy, with an extensive coverage on philosophy, mathematics, telecommunication and economics. All our theoretical designs have been double verified, first by the mathematicians via consensus modelling and numerical simulation and then by the computer and telecommunication expects in line with strict standards.
