    "HISTORY": "A brief retrospect of the blockchain history ",
    "HISTORY_CON1": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the famous paper entitled Bitcoin: a peer-to peer electronic cash system. Few months later, the genesis block of Bitcoin was minted with a text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”embedded in its coinbase, ushering in the age of Bitcoin blockchain. 2013 saw the release of the most important version of Bitcoin to date, which improved the inner management of bitcoin nodes and optimized the communication throughout the network. From then on, the cryptocurrency started to assume global influence. As the first of its kind, bitcoin proves to be a huge success. However, its development has been serious hindered by its ability to scale. We call this stage of bitcoin——Bitcoin Age 1.0.",
    "HISTORY_CON2": "To solve the scalability problem, Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum, another blockchain with clear design and structure. Since its inception, Ethereum has undergone several major developments, from the release of Ethereum Yellow Book to the crowdsale of Ether tokens, from the iteration of POC versions to the launch of Frontier, from PoW-based Metropolis to PoS-based Serenity. Ethereum, characterized by Turing-completeness, smart contract, ASIC-resistant algorithm and on-blockchain applications, has become the hallmark of Bitcoin Age 2.0. With the help of Ethereum’s platform interface and programming language, developers are able to write and release the next-generation Dapps.",
    "HISTORY_CON3": "The more recent blockchain developments need no introduction. In February 2018, bitcoin’s computing power reached 20EH/s, with more than 90,000 open-source projects running on Github. Developers from 90 countries including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and South Korea have joined the research on blockchain technologies. Compared with that of the Internet, blockchain’s growth was indeed dazzling. 1974 marked the genesis of the Internet, when ARPA published TCP/IP protocol. However, it was not until 20 years later that China was officially part of the international internet. The idea of blockchain, in contrast, immediately gained traction after the publication of bitcoin’s whitepaper. It only took a decade(2008-2018) for the technology to be known, trailed and tested by the public.",
    "WHAT_IS_ETM": "What is En-Tan-Mo",
    "WHAT_IS_ETM_CON": "En-Tan-Mo is a next-generation blockchain based on Nash equilibrium and the idea of value transfer. Its name emerged from Entente, Transaction and Mobius. The core En-Tan-Mo team includes Professor Thomas Sargent, leader of the rational expectation revolution and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics; Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow, the Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who proposed the Grand Unified Theory; as well as scholars from California Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland and the institut Henri Poincare who realized SHD completeness by innovatively incorporating game theory in blockchain development. En-Tan-Mo is a place where SCV miners and Pareto mining pool support and motivate each other under Kantorovich consensus, a platform that accommodates various applications and communities on different blockchains and non-blockchain systems, and a decentralized world where people longing for equality, democracy and genuine freedom are entitled to their fair share of stake. En-Tan-Mo goes beyond a blockchain-based platform. It is a community that carries the widest variety of applications and hosts the most extensive participants and the one that is built upon solid mathematical framework and guided by profound economic and philosophical thoughts. This White Book, therefore, is not sufficient to account for the significance and complexity of En-Tan-Mo, and merely serves as a brief introduction of the project. En-Tan-Mo development team is working on producing more papers with respect to En-Tan-Mo World, Philosophy, Math, Economics, Calculation and Ecology so as to shed more light on the project for interested readers. ",
    "ETM_BUILDERS": "En-Tan-Mo builders ",
    "ETM_BUILDERS_CON1": "En-Tan-Mo's designers and builders come from the world's top universities and research institutes. Originally the team was composed of mathematicians who applied game theory in the development of blockchain-based platforms and came up with the name“En-Tan-Mo”from Entente, Transaction and Mobius. It was later expanded by the accession of experts in the fields of telecommunication, computer science and economics. En-Tan-Mo team is also privileged to have Professor Thomas J. Sargent and Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow, two prominent Nobel Prize-winning scientists as senior advisors. All the theoretical designs of En-Tan-Mo have adopted a double process. Firstly, the mathematicians complete the consensus design. Secondly, researchers in computer science or telecommunications rigorously verify the theoretical results by numerical simulation and hardware experiments.",
    "ETM_BUILDERS_CON2": "What En-Tan-Mo has achieved so far would be impossible without the close cooperation between different teams and their directors who combine theory with practice, develop complementary software and hardware and integrate technology with commerce. The Kantorovich consensus mechanism is designed by experts in the fields of mathematics, telecommunications and computer science. The framework of En-Tan-Mo Science and the underlying stake distribution mechanism are proposed by experts who took part in Ethereum project and active users from the crypto-community. Also former software engineers from Google, Thunder, Baidu and other leading Internet companies with rich experience are contributing to the original code development of the project.",
    "ETM_BUILDERS_CON3": "More importantly, once the project is released online, the En-Tan-Mo builders will no longer be confined to members of the development team but include every user of En-Tan-Mo. As a self-evolutionary and participative system, En-Tan-Mo welcomes all users to actively upload compartments and develop derivative chains according to their needs. The En-Tan-Mo development team considers itself the initiator and infrastructure builder of this project. The team will do everything within its power to provide secure, stable and efficient technical service for future development. Moreover, it looks forward to collaborations with scientists, engineers and everyone who identifies with the ideas of En-Tan-Mo.",

    "SHD_COMPLETENESS_CON1": "CAP theorem states that it is impossible for distributed systems to provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance simultaneously. When it comes to blockchain, Satoshi Nakamoto observes that consensus can be reached via probabilistic strong consistency, which was later referred to as Nakamoto Consensus. ",
    "SHD_COMPLETENESS_CON2": "Similarly, there exists in blockchain-based platforms a problem called SHD Completeness. It implies that a trade-off has to be made among security, high-performance and decentralization. ",
    "SHD_COMPLETENESS_CON3": "On the premise of one-CPU-one-vote, Satoshi managed to ensure security and decentralization in Bitcoin blockchain but this has come at a cost. Due to Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm and block size design, it falls short on scalability. Only 7 transactions can be processed every second and only one block is mined every ten minutes. As a matter of fact, Bitcoin is flawed in more ways than one. Its decentralization was undermine by the emergence of super-efficient ASIC mining machines. Whereas mining machines reaping super-linear reward, the odds of an ordinary CPU effort mining a bitcoin dropped to approximately zero. The subsequent mining pools only made the situation worse. It is fair to say that Bitcoin blockchain is no longer the platform for equal participation as intended. As mining pools gradually increase their computing power, it seems only a matter of time before someone gains monopoly over 51% of the total computing resources of the network. Hence its security is also at stake. As such, we believe that Bitcoin blockchain has lost SHD completeness. ",
    "SHD_COMPLETENESS_CON4": "To counter the destructive effects brought by ASIC mining machine, Ethereum adopted Ethash, a ASIC-resistant algorithm, which for a while, maintained security and decentralization. However, CyptoKitties, the first large-scale application of smart contract which Ethereum takes great pride in, clogged up the network completely, laying bare the problem of low efficiency. A shift away from PoW towards PoS and DPoS has drastically improved the performance of Ethereum, yet to the detriment of decentralization. A network with few stakeholders holding sway is not essentially different from established centralized systems. under UPoS-based Kantorovich consensus, En-Tan-Mo blockchain introduces miner election mechanism which ensures the separation of token owners and mining machines and their respective stakes and interests. Thus, SHD completeness is attained without hurting security and decentralization.",

    "EQUILIBRIUM_CON1": "The age of the internet exponentially reduces the cost of information transmission and changes people’s way of thinking, enabling information to be transferred swiftly and conveniently and bringing about new product and services. Value transmission on the internet, on the other hand, is not peer-to-peer. It relies on centralized institutions for book-keeping. The reason is simple. For each transaction of value, uniqueness of ownership is indispensable. This is very different from information, because digital content is, for the most time, open for replication. ",
    "EQUILIBRIUM_CON2": "With distributed ledger, trust is established in bitcoin blockchain without a central authority, enabling value to transfer peer-to-peer and radically changing the way that information is transmitted and priced. However, powerful mining machines and mining pools broke the balance and tipped the scales in their favor. Value is now accumulating in mining pools at an alarming rate.",
    "EQUILIBRIUM_CON3": "Ethereum has, to a certain extent, slowed down the speed of value accumulation via ASIC-resistant algorithm and “gas”. But this approach, as we see it, is neither constructive and nor effective in the long run. Turning from PoW to PoS and DPoS, which was intended as a way to break the monopoly of computational resources and realize equilibrium, ended up putting value in the hands of a few powerful token owners, making Ethereum more centralized than ever before. ",
    "EQUILIBRIUM_CON4": "It is a fact that the 80/20 rule applies to cryptocurrency and blockchain, meaning 80% of the value generated in blockchain is controlled by 20% of the mining population. En-Tan-Mo hopes to change the way value is transmitted and enable it to move around freely and openly by means of a balanced and equitable value transfer system. In En-Tan-Mo blockchain, participants are both the service seller and buyer in a decentralized market with a built-in price adjusting mechanism that allows price to form in a dynamic and self-organized way. En-Tan-Mo applies Mean Field theory to the study of dynamic price formulation, and makes sure that computing power and voting right are subject to a positive but non-linear relationship. This will rein in power concentration and create a new generation of IoV which will revolutionize business models and socio-economic activities.",

    "KANTOROVICH_CONSENSUS_CON": "The essential idea of Kantorovich consensus is to achieve optimal allocation of resources through decentralization",
    "KANTOROVICH_CONSENSUS_CON1": "Kantorovich consensus protocol is a revolutionary kind of proof of stake protocol. It provides the rules by which all mining nodes will eventually reach consensus in networks. The algorithm is the key part in the En-Tan-Mo infrastructure and represents a great leap forward in blockchain technology. The Kantorovich consensus design has improved on energy-intensive PoW protocols to overcome long-standing obstacles to the extension of blockchain applications. The algorithm is designed by the game theory team led by ETM Science Advisory Board and has gone through peer review. It is the first secure UPoS (United Proof of Stake), supported by rigorous scientific process.",
    "KANTOROVICH_CONSENSUS_CON2": "On En-Tan-Mo, Nash equilibrium is a concept that comes from both mathematics and economics. Due to the Kantorovich consensus mechanism design in En-Tan-Mo, each user can assume the role of either miner or voter in order to participate in the construction of the blockchain and obtains due rewards on a balanced basis. Interactions between all users are regulated by simple but very effective consensus protocols so as to ensure the collective state of strategies reaches Nash equilibrium.",
    "KANTOROVICH_CONSENSUS_CON3": "En-Tan-Mo and its consensus mechanism aims to provide a system in which all participants are direct recipients of benefits. Benefits cannot be monopolized by large mining pools or big shareholders, and thus fundamental reforms have to start from consensus mechanisms. Players in the En-Tan-Mo game are all users and they can be categorized by their different kinds of identities: SCV miner, tribunal, and Pareto miner (a members of a Pareto mining pool). They obtain ETM tokens or other rewards by either voting or producing blocks. SCV miners are elected and they cooperate in extending blockchain in an orderly way within a given period. Even though a dishonest miner has less to lose because of the decreased cost of mining, he will suffer greater loss if he is expelled from the SCV mining group due to his dishonest behavior having been detected. In order to increase the efficiency of En-Tan-Mo blocks construction process, tribunals have the duty to select the best SCV miner and will be rewarded with ETM tokens for so doing. The proportional voting stake is related to proportional token stake by a concave function so as to ensure fairness for the majority of stake holders. SCV miners and tribunals are independent and interconnected at the same time in different respects so that the distribution of power and stakes is clear and in equilibrium. Miners in Pareto mining pools at their current status cannot obtain ETM token rewards but they can participate in the mining of other blockchain systems as part of an entente effort. This arrangement ensures the interests of all miners at all times. Therefore, by dual consensus protocols in which DPoS and PoW are coupled, the strategies of all players in En-Tan-Mo will evolve during interactions between different types of identities and eventually converge to Nash Equilibrium. ",
    "KANTOROVICH_CONSENSUS_CON4": "En-Tan-Mo will supply users with decentralized applications in domains such as finance, public service, internet of things, new sharing economy and supply chains.",

    "NASH_EQUILIBRIUM": "Nash equilibrium",
    "NASH_EQUILIBRIUM_CON": "The most important concept in En-Tan-Mo consensus is Nash equilibrium, which was introduced by the American mathematician and Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. It can be defined as a stable state system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain unchanged.",
    "KANTOROVICH": "Kantorovich",
    "KANTOROVICH_CON": "The reason we use the name Kantorovich consensus is because we are inspired by the work of Leonid Kantorovich, the Soviet mathematician who won the Nobel prize in economics in 1975. He proposed a strict mathematical model for studying optimal transport and Kantorovich duality theorem. This theory showed that optimal allocation can be achieved by decentralized price system. The economic theory of Kantorovich was for a long time rejected and criticized by “orthodox” academics in Soviet Union.",
    "TRIBUNALS": "Tribunals",
    "TRIBUNALS_CON": "Stake holders voting to select SCV miners are called tribunals. The proportional token stake of each tribunal is mapped into a number of voting tickets by a concave function. During each period voting will be rewarded. Eligible miners can become SCVs by winning sufficient votes and will then be able to upload verified blocks in order to obtain tokens as rewards.",
    "PARETO_MINING_POOL": "Pareto mining pool",
    "PARETO_MINING_POOL_CON": "In En-Tan-Mo, all miners form a cooperative mining pool. In each period, selected SCVs extend the chain in an orderly way. En-Tan-Mo organizes all unselected miners to form a Pareto mining pool. By using specially designed side-chain technologies, coalition strategies and analytical algorithms of potential real-time income, these miners participate in the mining of other blockchain systems. The rewards are distributed according to their computational resources and ensure positive outcomes for all miners.",

    "CENTRA-DERIVED_CHAINS_CON1": "Among the many problems faced by blockchain systems, the lack of interoperability between blockchains greatly limits the application potential. For both public and private chains the key to achieving value transfer is through inter-chain technologies. These technologies can build bridges to connect and expand previously isolated blockchain systems. What they can achieve is more value lock-in rather than more value transfer. Based on investigations of current interchain technologies, En-Tan-Mo proposes a new parallel chain interactive protocol to facilitate value transfer and build a blockchain ecosystem that can include apps each with over ten millions users.",
    "CENTRA-DERIVED_CHAINS_CON2": "In order to solve the problem of rapid expansion and BaaS, En-Tan-Mo has designed a system of one central chain with multiple derivative chains. The central chain is responsible for network security and value transfer. A derivative chain is a special kind of blockchain targeted at specific DAPP. It is an independent and isolated system. By inheriting and replicating technologies from the central chain, each DAPP has its own ledger and token system. Its consensus mechanism, block parameter and transaction types can be customized. Derivative chains are parallel to each other.  They can achieve bidirectional transfer of assets between the central chain, other derivative chains, and external blockchain systems through the 'parallel chain interaction layer'. This enables users to utilize their existing assets to use the En-Tan-Mosystem.",

    "PARALLEL_CHAIN_CON1":"En-Tan-Mo’s parallel chain interaction protocol makes it possible to support value transfer between different blockchains. It mainly consists of two parts: a chain-adaptation module and a value exchange smart contract. The main purpose of designing a chain adapter is to provide En-Tan-Mo interaction interfaces with different chains for value exchange smart contracts in order to verify transactions on different chains. Simultaneously, builders in the community can themselves develop and improve on chain adaptors for diversified functions and obtain tokens as rewards. For example, applications can switch between underlying blockchains with different protocols using chain adaptors. Value exchange protocol is the core of parallel interaction protocols.  It enables users to exchange capital on and between all kinds of blockchains, including central, derivative and external chains. An internet system of interchain value connection will be thus constructed. ",

    "SAMRT_CONTRACT": "Value exchange smart contract",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON": "Turing complete virtual machine which can provide sufficient security protection",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON1": "Although the innovative technology of blockchain has long been a global focus, there has always been a problem: value transactions between different blockchain systems still require third-party middlemen such as exchanges, and it is these that need to be replaced by decentralization technology. En-Tan-Mo uses minimum trust smart contract and chain adapters to replace these middlemen and function as bridge between different chains. This method has deepened the connection between the two most important elements in blockchains and brought En-Tan-Mo closer to becoming a global value transfer network.",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON2": "Value exchange smart contracts rely on En-Tan-Mo's Turing complete virtual machine to operate and provide users with adequate security. A value exchange smart contract between central and derivative chains is like a decentralized exchange. It has an ETM wallet address and control over it on corresponding chains. Once a user initiates a transfer on a derivative chain which is recognized by the central chain adapter, the value exchange smart contract will automatically transfer an equivalent amount to the user’s ETM wallet address on the central chain to complete the exchange of value. Simultaneously, En-Tan-Mo has incorporated Hash Time Lock Constructs in order to eliminate risk for users during exchanges.",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON3": "For the specific exchange process, let us take the exchange of Bitcoin and ETM as an example. The steps are as follows:",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON4": "Bitcoin blockchain User A must first register with En-Tan-Mo to bind the mapping relationship between User A's ETM wallet address and the BTC wallet address;",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON5": "User A generates a random secret number (a) and finds its hash value H(a). Then, a special transaction is initiated on the bitcoin blockchain to the Bitcoin address of the valueexchange smart contract, which is locked for 12 hours based on Hash Time Lock Controls technology. The En-Tan-Mo value exchange smart contract must produce a hash image H(a) of the original image in order to obtain the token,. Otherwise, 12 hours later, the BTC of the transaction automatically returns to user A's Bitcoin wallet address.",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON6": "The En-Tan-Mo smart contract monitors the confirmation of these special transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain through the bitcoin chain adapter and performs SPV verification. Once the SPV verification is passed, the En-Tan-Mo Value Exchange Smart Contract initiates a special transaction in the central chain to User A's ETM wallet address, which is locked for 6 hours.If User A wants to obtain the ETM token in the transaction, the original image (a) of the hash value H(a) must be presented. Otherwise, the ETM token in the transaction is automatically returned to the ETM wallet address of the smart contract after 6 hours.Once User A presents the secret number (a) to retrieve the ETM token in the transaction, the smart contract will know the secret number (a), so the smart contract can access the Bitcoin blockchain network through the adapter and accept User A as a user. So in the transaction Bitcoin has been transferred from one user to another. The transaction is then complete. ",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON7": "The transaction is then complete.",
    "SAMRT_CONTRACT_CON8": "What needs to be emphasized is that the central chain is only used as a decentralized value exchange, and it does not rely on locking in User A's Bitcoin to achieve value transfer. User A transfers Bitcoin to the smart contract Bitcoin wallet address, and smart contracts can be used for those users who want to exchange ETM tokens for Bitcoin.At the same time, after User A exchanges bitcoins for ETM tokens, these tokens can be transferred back to not only the bitcoin blockchain but also to other external blockchain tokens through the same process. Therefore, what En-Tan-Mo achieves is value exchange, not asset locking. In addition, all value exchange smart contract addresses initially have zero tokens. They need investment from corresponding blockchain users. In return, the smart contract distributes the transaction fees spent by the user during the value exchange process to the appropriate investors in proportion to their investment. During the investment process, users can retrieve investment funds from smart contracts at any time.In sum, based on value exchange smart contract, what En-Tan-Mo will construct is an inter-chain value network. En-Tan-Mo does not create value out of thin air but serves as an agent of value transfer. ",

The distribution plan is as follows:32% of the initial supply will be created to the En-Tan-Mo private placement to fund technical development and market operations.10% will go to En-Tan-Mo Foundation for the purpose of supporting the building of miner, developer and investor community ecology plus rewarding DPoS tribunals for their voting efforts.48% will be created to PoW miners. The issuance is expected to be completed by the sixth year after the official release of ETM project. New ETM created per year will steadily decline and the share is 12%, 10%,8%,8%,6%,4% respectively.Development team and early contributors will obtain 10% of the ETM supply and there will be a lock-in period after the main chain is released online.In the future, some ETM will be lost due to varied reasons. And as the project continues to develop, on-blockchain Dapp will proliferate and thrive, injecting fresh vitality into the network and bringing about benefits. For this reasons, a DPoS-based voting will decide on the rate of additional issuance on a yearly basis, starting from the seventh year. The new issuance will not exceed 5% of the current total and go to the reward for PoW miners,DPoS voters and quality Dapps.",
